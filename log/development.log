The methods in the following tutorial work in nvda(see the last section), and jaws. Please keep in mind, however, that you will have to restart the et-eliquence synthesizer, or change the inflection to 30 and the voice pitch to 65 whenever your song is done to send the voice back to normal, and the speed must also be however fast you want it to be, in my case 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><strong>table of contents<br />\r\n1. introduction.<br />\r\n2. requirements<br />\r\n3. sintax<br />\r\n4. assigning values<br />\r\n5. notes<br />\r\n6.

Notes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><strong>No, this isn&rsquo;t final notes. This is the chapter that tells you how to write the notes.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><strong>In my system of writing notes in this, since you must use pitches, I base it off the second lowest e on a piano keyboard. Here&rsquo;s how it sounds:</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vf0</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb76 here&rsquo;s the middle e</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb65 </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vf30<br />\r\nSo, now you get an idea. I base all my notes off of that. It&rsquo;s weird, because some notes you must go up by one pitch value(say vb76 is e and vb77 would be f. In fact, here&rsquo;s an example. I will do a d#, e, f, and f# and then will tell you the values.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vf0</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb72 vb72 is D</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb73 d# is vb73</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb75e is vb76</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb77 f is vb77</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb78 f# is vb78</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb80 vb80 is g</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb81 vb81 is g#</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb83 vb83 is A</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vf30 </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vb65<br />\r\nSo there you go. Note that you can use those numbers(I mean base your notes on the high E, count how many sharps and notes are down or up until the note you want, and if it doesn&rsquo;t sound right(too high), change the vb value down some and if it sounds too low, change it down. Here&rsquo;s an example):<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s say I want to write a low e, (</strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vf0</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb52 low e) </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vf30 </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vb65<br />\r\nSee? Here&rsquo;s what I did:<br />\r\n1. I realised the middle e was vb76.<br />\r\n2. I counted down by 2:<br />\r\nvb74=d#, vb72=d, vb70=c#, vb68=c, vb66=b, vb64=a#, vb62=a, vb60=g#, vb58=g, vb56=f#, vb54=f, vb52=e.<br />\r\nI know that vb65=a# in the real world, but then again I was acting like you went down by 2 every time you changed the pitch by note or note sharp, and it worked. Remember that if vb52 hadn&rsquo;t been what I wanted, I could&rsquo;ve changed that value to vb53, vb51, vb50, or vb54.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><strong>6.

This is the chapter that tells you how to write the notes.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><strong>In my system of writing notes in this, since you must use pitches, I base it off the second lowest e on a piano keyboard.

I base all my notes off of that. It&rsquo;s weird, because some notes you must go up by one pitch value(say vb76 is e and vb77 would be f. In fact, here&rsquo;s an example. I will do a d#, e, f, and f# and then will tell you the values.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vf0</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb72 vb72 is D</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb73 d# is vb73</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb75e is vb76</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb77 f is vb77</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb78 f# is vb78</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb80 vb80 is g</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb81 vb81 is g#</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb83 vb83 is A</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vf30 </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vb65<br />\r\nSo there you go. Note that you can use those numbers(I mean base your notes on the high E, count how many sharps and notes are down or up until the note you want, and if it doesn&rsquo;t sound right(too high), change the vb value down some and if it sounds too low, change it down. Here&rsquo;s an example):<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s say I want to write a low e, (</strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vf0</strong><br />\r\n<strong>‵</strong><strong>vb52 low e) </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vf30 </strong><strong>‵</strong><strong>vb65<br />\r\nSee? Here&rsquo;s what I did:<br />\r\n1. I realised the middle e was vb76.<br />\r\n2. I counted down by 2:<br />\r\nvb74=d#, vb72=d, vb70=c#, vb68=c, vb66=b, vb64=a#, vb62=a, vb60=g#, vb58=g, vb56=f#, vb54=f, vb52=e.<br />\r\nI know that vb65=a# in the real world, but then again I was acting like you went down by 2 every time you changed the pitch by note or note sharp, and it worked. Remember that if vb52 hadn&rsquo;t been what I wanted, I could&rsquo;ve changed that value to vb53, vb51, vb50, or vb54.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><strong>6.
